# COFFEE MACHINE PROJECT

#### Track: Introduction to Java
#### Difficulty: Challenging


In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
