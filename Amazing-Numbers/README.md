# AMAZING NUMBERS PROJECT

### Language: Java
### Difficulty: Easy

After completing this project, you will write a program that knows how to determine whether a number is Palindromic or Gapful, or how to distinguish Spy numbers from others. Numbers can be fascinating!


Available properties:
- **Buzz**: numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7. 
- **Duck**: positive number that contains zeroes. For example, 3210, 8050896, 70709 are Duck numbers.
- **Palindromic**: number is symmetrical; in other words, it stays the same regardless of whether we read it from left or right. 
- **Gapful**: number that contains at least 3 digits and is divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit without a remainder
- **Spy**: number where the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.
- **Sunny and Square**: number is **sunny** if N + 1 is a **perfect square**. In mathematics, a square number or a perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of an integer with itself, e.g. 9.
- **Jumping**: number where the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered as 1. Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers. For example, 78987, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers, but 796 and 89098 are not.
- **Happy and Sad**: a happy number is a number that reaches 1 after a sequence during which the number is replaced by the sum of each digit squares. For example, 13 is a happy number, as 12 + 32 = 10 which leads to 12 + 02 = 1. On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starts with 42 = 16, 12 + 62 = 37, and finally reaches 22 + 02 = 4. This is the number that started the sequence, so the process goes on in an infinite cycle. A number that is not happy is called Sad (or Unhappy).
